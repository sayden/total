TOTally Awesome Language

A hobby project to practice Flex/Bison that ended up in writing my own lexer... which probably wasn't necessary anyways.

```
user: {
    long_text: >'this' is "maaaadnessss" <
    list_of_strings: [as asdf asdfa]
    key: value
    number: 12
    another_key: another value
    OneMore4: asda
    whatifitsnull: null
    another_number: 99
    inner_block: {
        inner_key: inner_value
        list_of_numbers: [1 2 3]
        more_inner: {
            hello: world
        }
    }
    list_of_blocks: [
        {
            hello: world
        }
    ]
}
```
